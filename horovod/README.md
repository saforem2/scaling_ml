**Goal:**

1. Understand how to run jobs on Theta / ThetaGPU
2. Get familiar with the software frameworks on Theta / ThetaGPU
3. Understand Data Parallelism (scaling efficiency, warmup, etc)
4. Know how to modify your code to work with Horovod

## Model Parallelism and Data Parallelism

1. **Model parallelization:** In this scheme, disjoint subsets of a neural network are assigned to different devices. Therefore, all the computation associated with the subsets are distributed. Communication happens between devices whenever there is dataflow between two subsets. Model parallelization is suitable when the model is too large to fit into a single device (CPU/GPU) because of the memory capacity. However, partitionining the model into different subsets is not an easy task, and there might potentially introduce load imbalance issues limiting the scaling efficiency.
2. **Data parallelization:** In this scheme, all of the workers own a replica of the model. The global batch of data is split into multiple minibatches and processed by different workers. Each worker computes the corresponding loss and gradients with respect to the data it possesses. Before the updating of the parameters at each epoch, the loss and gradients are averaged among all the workers through a collective operation. This scheme is relatively simple to implement. `MPI_Allreduce` is the only communication operation required.

### Example:

- How the model **weights** are split over cores ([image credit][2]):

  - Shapes of different sizes in this row represent larger weight matrics in the networks' layers.
